# The Roll for initiative

![](images/ch6.jpg)

There are tons of things that can catch us off guard in life. New perspectives, new relationships, new kids, new jobs, heck even new food can shoot your wheels off (especially if you are allergic to it).  The point is that we can spend so much time on expecting the unexpected than we lose site on one of the best and most amazing experiences in life - being surprised. 

The first time I found out I was going to be a dad I was massively surprised and confused. I remember thinking how exciting it was going to be while considering how terrifyingly unprepared we were. After our fifth kiddo I was much less surprised but even number five brought her own little unexpected delights. 

We have a dangerous tendency to think that we have more than enough mental dexterity to anticipate life's little explosions. Combine that with the idea that fear of the unknown is paralyzing and you've got yourself one mind blowing paradox.  It's almost as if we spend loads of time preparing for something were afraid we'll never do!

I remember building a new computer. My first experience with computing had been a TRS-80 and I was about to graduate to the 32-bit world of micro processing. It was a 386 or better known as an [i386](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80386) packing a whopping 275,000 transistors  and capable of 32-bit operations.

Running at a cool 33 MHz I thought, "what can I do with all of this power?!"  Take over governments, write the Asimov predicted AI, melt faces like Indiana Jones - the possibilities were endless! Once I finished assembling the machine I flipped the switch to turn it on (literally there was a "switch " it was red and the "click" it made a sound  like a herd of unicorns dancing on a rainbow). In anticipation, I waited for the CPU to register and the memory to count up and then it happened…

BEEP…BEEP…BEEP…BEEP

Nothing but silence after that. No fans, no clicks, no BEEPs; the unicorns had fallen off the rainbow.   I was now caught "flat footed" and had failed my initiative roll. So in comes the choice every role player has to make with any encounter they have: stay and fight or run away. 

The fact is that we all have these defining moments, big or small throughout life. We can choose to move the family or we can stay, we can change from a salaried employee to a contractor or just stay where we are, we can teach our kids to solder or we can decide that's too "dangerous."  Regardless of the moment we all have to roll for initiative some time and we all have to decide what to do with the results. I'm not talking about a notion of chance or statistical probability but rather an opportunity to make a choice. 

When rolling, fear can be a powerful factor. It can tear you down or it can be a powerful motivator. You see, when those four beeps rung in my ears I had absolutely no clue what to do or even what was next. There was no Google to help guide me through, no instructions or Geek squad. There was just me and a pile of silicon and solder. I was facing a monster and it was wielding a +4 club of hardware failure. This was a moment of adversity. 

Many great individuals have been born from adversity, rough starts and challenged paths: 

[Ada Lovelace](http://www.biography.com/people/ada-lovelace-20825323) dealt with an absent father and numerous health issues.  It took roughly 100 years after her death for her contributions in computer science to be added to her legacy, making her the world's first computer programmer.

[Bill Gate's](http://www.biography.com/people/bill-gates-9307520) with friend Paul Allen first company "Traf-O-Data" initially was considered unsuccessful. He later founded one of the world's largest software companies, Microsoft and is now considered one of the richest person in the world.

[Stephen King's](http://www.biography.com/people/stephen-king-9365136) first novel was rejected 30 times but then a year later was published as a huge success.  He is now known around the world for his critically-acclaimed titles that have sold over 350 million copies!

[Thomas Edison](http://www.biography.com/people/thomas-edison-9284349) failed many times trying numerous materials (the real number is unknown) while trying to create a new filament to make the incandescent electric light a viable device. He is now considered one of America's greatest business leaders who helped to shape its economy.

[Vincent van Gogh](http://www.biography.com/people/vincent-van-gogh-9515695) sold only one painting for 400 francs during his lifetime. Today he is considered to be one of the greatest Dutch painters and his paintings are some of the most expensive in the world.

[Franklin Roosevelt](http://www.biography.com/people/franklin-d-roosevelt-9463381) was paralyzed from polio. He ended up leading the United States through the Great Depression, WWII and has been the only president in US history to be elected to office for four terms (prior to the twenty-second amendment).

[Lucille Ball](http://www.biography.com/people/lucille-ball-9196958) was known in Hollywood initially as the "queen of 'B' movies" and her childhood was filled with tragedy and money challenges. She is now considered to be one of the most beloved comedians of all time and had a tremendously successful career.

[Stephen Hawking](http://www.biography.com/people/stephen-hawking-9331710) was diagnosed at age 21 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Despite his illness he has made crucial contributions to the field of physics and other sciences.

[Stan Lee](http://www.biography.com/people/stan-lee-21101093#synopsis) spent part of his childhood surviving the great depression with his parents and his younger brother. He is responsible for shaping most of what many of us know and experience with "comics" today.

At the end of the day these people were just people like you and me. Maybe they all had a great deal of mental fortitude, perhaps they all just had a great deal of endurance but we all share something in common - the ability to make a choice regardless of the circumstances.

I personally chose to use the fear of the unknown and decided to use that as fuel to learn as much as I possibly could about computing, starting with four ominous beeps. Thirty years later I love every minute that I get a chance to write software with amazingly talented people while learning something new just about every day.  We can sit there and think about "trying" all day long but without the "do" we're just burning a clock. 

 I think Yoda said it best: 
"There is no try there is only do and do not."

Was it because the i386 hijinks years ago or that I was obsessed with how programmers [Toshihiko Nakago](http://nintendo.wikia.com/wiki/Toshihiko_Nakago) and Kazuaki Morita
 at Nintendo were able to make [Mario](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.) jump and eat mushrooms? I don't know, it was probably a combination of several things. What I do know is that the choices we make can and will shape our lives and our family and friend's lives.

It turns out that my video card was "unseated" and all I really need to do was push it in a bit more.

 I wonder if we took a step back and looked at what we are doing and considered why we are doing it would we find areas that simply need a little push to get us running like we should be running.
