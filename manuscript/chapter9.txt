# The End Is The Beginning

![](images/ch9.jpg)

5…4…3…2…1… this is the end.  

At least that's what I thought as my heart was still trying to recover from the stimpack injection from almost having someone call [finalize](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.object.finalize(v=vs.110).aspx) on me by either the car in the oncoming lane or the train on my right. Do you remember? I was just coming back from an all night deployment were I thought I was being exceptional and doing everything I could to "succeed" at a job where I was not happy (mostly my own doing); physically destroying myself for the illusion of being passionate about building software.  

It's strange how coming so close to running out of those little hearts in the upper right hand corner of life's screen makes you stop and consider the absurdity of a situation. What is it about a dirt nap that drives us to wake up and dig our way out? Why can't we have that clarity without risking mortality?

**Life asks so much from each of us.** We all go through our own trials and tribulations. We all have broken hearts and misaligned expectations. Despite all of that we all still have an opportunity to make a choice. I made that choice and I try continue to make that choice every day. 

What is the choice? I'll get to that in a bit. Right now let me tell you how the story ends… 

As you might've already guessed I did not die that day and I did not give up on software. In fact part of me came alive. I pulled over onto the shoulder to deal with what just happened.  Silence. Confusion. Terror.  You know those moments in life were you playback sweaty palm events, editing and replaying how it could've gone? These are the moments when time stops and you continue to shoot adrenaline into your heart with each new version of what could've been. Even now as I relive the multitude of ways I could've left this earth I'm anxious.  I really shouldn't be anxious though, last time I checked the mortality rate is still 100%, funeral homes are big business and frankly I should be putting my hope in a more important place.
 
I thought of the many, many times that I both put my life at risk as well as the lives of those around me for something that seemed so important.  Then I began asking my self one simple question: 

"Am I doing what I was created to do?" Surely I was not just here to put my carbon foot print in the dirt then leave, right?

What are the important things to you? Your friends, your kids, your spouse, cooking a great meal, going to church, writing code, traveling, making an impact?  

I began biking to work shortly after we moved to Portland, OR. This was a whole new experience for me because you simply would never commute on a bike in Dallas,TX. The heat and the [Frogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger) like road conditions alone were more than enough to keep and pedestrian or bike traffic off the road.

I had some amazing bike nerds from New Relic backing me up with my new 24 mile round trip adventure. As a side bar I truly feel that's what we should be doing throughout our life: encouraging each other in our uncertainties and sharing what we love to do and why we do it. 

**I hated it.**  Bottom line I was a terrible biker, never mind the fact that there was absolutely no good reason for me to be biking to work given the multitude of commuting options available to me in the great bridge city. 

It was like taking a person who has played first person shooters (driving to work) their entire life and telling them they could now only play massively multiplayer online games (bike to work). Frankly, it seemed about as smart and as useful as a bag of broken hammers in {Donkey Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong).

I continued to do it because: 
	1. I was being encouraged by some amazing people
	2. I noticed something on the faces and in the hearts of the other bikers on my commute. 

It was subtle initially but it really became apparent when I was riding in a heavy rain. The commuters were smiling. Crazy, yes. Nutty, I know right?! They were riding on the same path I was on, in the same rain as well! So what was it? What made these people enjoy it so much?  

I continued riding and I purposefully paid more attention. It's going to sound cliché but **I intentionally made it about the journey and not the destination.**  It's like grinding wombats in a game to get the "crown of unsightly behavior" or something like it. We get so locked in on the prize we forget to make getting it fun.

Riding down the [Springwater Corridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springwater_Corridor) there were expansive fields of flowers that looked like a freshly painted Monet. There was the Willamette river and the "eights" filled with rowers sliding along the river as if it were glass.  There were homeless camps were I took the chance to sit down with some amazing folks and chat about life in Oregon. There were dear that raced down the train track with me and an amusement park where the cheers of a hundred voices made me ride faster as if they were cheering me on! 

There was beauty everywhere and a million experiences to be had and all I had to do was stop and smell the metaphorical roses.  

Then it happened. I had a smile on my face. Was it a touchy feely moment; not at all. It happened when I caught a light rail track with my front wheel and I flew over my handlebars. I was laying on my back smiling thinking about how I now understand why the signs with the guy falling off the bike were not really that funny after all. 

Then it hit me. **I smile when I write code!** It turns out that when you are genuinely passionate about something two very interesting things happen:

	1. You have tons of joy doing what your passionate about
	2. You want to share it with anyone who will listen

The fact is that your passion does not need to have a reason for existing - it is its own reason. I went on to share my crazy excitement about commuting to work with whoever would listen. I was leaking excitement and passion everywhere like Ninja Turtle ooze, hoping for a mutation here or there.  

You see your passion is a virus and you are patent zero.  Though this virus is vastly different from any other virus in the world and it is distinct and unique.  You are the only one who can "carry" it and when it infects someone else it mutates to their own creative thing and they then become patent zero.

My son and I were having a conversation about building things and he stonewalled me with this question:

"Dad, what if there was no creativity in the world?"

"Uhhh, well…"

He continued, "I mean, do you think we could even survive."

"Nah I don't think so.  If there were no people sharing what they loved to do and how they do it how could things ever get made or get better"

"Hehe, yeah it would be like we only had vanilla ice cream but humanity needed neo, neopolo…."

"Neapolitan ice cream?"

"Yeah, that's the one… You know dad, it would really be hard to live on earth and not be creative."

I have six beautiful children.  Each one is unique.  My wife and I have put all of them in front of technology, programming, hardware, art, literature and the like and something amazing has happened every time we've done that.  They discover a little more about themselves each time they do.

My son Caden (11 years) loves to program, game and read.

My son Jonah (9 years) loves hardware, soldering and builds IOT stuff.

My son Levi (7 years) loves to build things and structures with Legos or any other materials he can find.

My son Dylan (5 years) loves to adventure in the wilderness, find materials and build weapons and tools with them

My daughter Ruth (3 years) loves to paint and solder with me

My daughter Ava (2 years) loves to be a mad scientist and test out everything (especially her parents).

I've tried to be the same dad and they've had the same amazing mom - so why the difference in passions? Because over time despite what we have taught them others in their lives, the things they read and experience has created a whole new creativity virus in them.  Without humanities legacy of creativity and others before us having the courage to share what they love with the world we'd be challenged with the additional burden of cutting new paths. As my son pointed out using a frozen sweetened flavored bovine secretion as an example, "it would really be hard to live on earth and not be creative."

Do you smile when you're building stuff or writing code (smiles on the inside count too)?

Do you want to share your latest hack with your kids, friends or spouse?

When was the last time your heart raced when you were on the cusp of solving a really hard problem?

Life requires a lot from us.  I like to try to stand by a principle that came to me when I was looking in the mirror one day:

**Ripples not wrinkles.**

At the end of your life you'll look back and see the handful of decisions that have changed the course of your life and the lives of others around you. It's like throwing a stone in a pond.  These are your "ripples" - the things you did that genuinely made an impact on something or someone. The hope is that your have more ripples than you do wrinkles.

Do you remember that choice I was eluding to earlier?  We all get to make it every day. This is the same choice that people like [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace), [Rear Admiral Grace Hopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper#UNIVAC), [Markus Persson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markus_Persson), [Jonathan Gillette a.k.a._why the lucky stiff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff) and so many more before us have made. 

We can either choose to be **exceptional** or we can choose to be **mediocre**. No matter what we choose the result will inevitably infect our family and friends. Being exception is not having ninja-like skills when you cut up vegetables, being right all of the time. By no means does exceptional mean famous, rich or successful by the worlds standards; though sometimes those are the byproducts. 

No, what I am referring to is a choice to find, share and do what you love to do without wavering. Being a nerd in the purest sense in the place where you cannot help but smile. 

Find what you love to do, share it with others and you will have achieved Nerd Life Balance.
