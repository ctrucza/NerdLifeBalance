# The Great Disception

If you took the little "test" from the previous chapter you might be feeling a bit deflated or perhpase overwhelmed. Hopefully it helped you consider new ways to refactor you life. However you might be feeling now the idea here is that there's been a grand lie that has been passed around since we as humainty begain counting in hours. The lie is simple yet really, really effective at helping us defeat ourselves.

>"There are 168 hours in every week."

Ok, so perhaps that's not a completely true lie. Let me try that again...

>"There are 168 'usable' hours in every week."

The fact is that we have black holes and dynamos for the little time we have here on this earth. Somethings we do effectively absorb the mass of time we have while other things we do can somethimes feel like they help "generate" new time.

In 1979 there was a science fiction film named "The Black Hole." I had a book with a record that I played a few thousand times. The robot on the U.S.S Palomino named V.I.N.C.E.N.T remarked, "A black hole, the deadliest force in the universe, nothing can escape it!"

How amazingly accurate is that description when we think about all the time we have that passes quickly? There are always gaps in time, leaky timperal faucets that cause the time we have to simply dissipear. There are ways to deal with the theoretical gravity of your minute draining anomoly, but first you have to accept this framework called time is a bit of a farse. Not because it is not scientific or that it has not been proven as a metric that can be measured and used - no the problem with time has nothing to do with time at all. Our problem with time has all to do with us and our effective utilization of a limited resource that has no limit. 

It is as though we treat time more like Tribbles and less like a scarse resource. We measure it loosly against the begging of time and see no reason to be concerned that as an individual consumer we can only consume so much time. It's a lot like eating pringles, for some reason you can't stop consuming the salty round tricksers but then the can is empty and your eyes are open to the fact that each of the 300 unstoppable pops tasted less like salt and vinegar and more like regret.

Recently I was chatting with a software developer. We were discussing if participating in a hackathon would be something that was worth doing. I asked her if it was a technology that she'd been wanting to try out and from there we continuted talking about the pros and cons of parrticipating. We ended the conversation with this simple, yet powerful dialog:

>"her: I'm interested in all of it [game development]"
>"me: here's the deal... worst case if you participate you not finish the game but you would've at least learned something"
>"me: remember you're not guaranteed tomorrow, why put off to tomorrow what you could do today?"

As we were talking was downloading the SDK and creating a new repository. 

Will it become something? 
I don't know.

Will I regret trying to create something new?
Probably not.

WIll I learn something that I might be able to share with others?
Definitely.

You see this whole concept of "time" forces our thinking right into military meal thinking where we don't let our carrots touch our peas - those two things used to go together really well. Military meal thinking forces us to "timebox" things and never let any cross over happen and also forces us to constrain any thing that might not fit into a "work life" box. If you've ever cancelled a new project before you even started it because you feel you'll not have enough time you might be a victim of time compartmentalization.

I'm not trying to be a Time Cop, that's Jean-Claude Van Damme's job. I'm simply pointing out we as the human race has unfathomable potential to do some really amazing things and that we might be able to do those things if we simply try. 

I think the one of the greatest lies we could tell ourselves is that we'll do x later. Use the following checklist to see if you have more black holes than dynamos in your life:

 Phrase                                          | Times said |
|------------------------------------------------|------------|
| I'll do that next week                         |    ________|
| I don't have time                              |    ________|
| I'll do x later                                |    ________|
| In just a minute...                            |    ________|
| There is always time for x                     |    ________|
| Hey let's catch up later                       |    ________|
| We should meet for x sometime                  |    ________|
| I need to do x                                 |    ________|
| Average time spent on [_________________]      |    ________|
| Average time spent on [_________________]      |    ________|
| Average time spent on [_________________]      |    ________|

I pretty much fail this test every time and here's why. Only recently I discovered something really important. So important that it has completely changed the way I communicate and the way I think. I discovered this:

>"No is a complete sentance."

Opting out of things because it was simply something I just could not do has always been a really difficult thing for me to do. The fact is that there are just somethings we simply cannot do. Either they simply just do not fit our passion or they do not align with our priorities; whatever the case may be a simple "No" can go a really long way. Think about it this way, when we try to justify our actions it can and does come across to most people like Hollywood trying to convence the techincally savy to accept thier latest Hackor disaterpeice. It sounds and feels rediculious.

Justification is simply another way to defer dealing with something else. The fact is that time is finite and our consumption of that construct is paramount. It's critical how we consume it. It's like running around in Half-Life and using up all of the health and suit chargers before trying to down the boss - it will all be used up and you'll have nothing left for the second wave.

Do you belive we have a tendencty to lie to ourselves? I do. If we could better, more purposuly utilize what we have it would keep us from insanity driven behaviors like comparmentalization and time paraysis.

When we take chunks of things and stick them in compartments the space between the compartments is lost. Sometimes when I have been staring at broken bit of code or problem for a while I need a new perspective. My kids are that perspective. Children exhibit this amazing ability to see bast all of the cruft we as "seasoned" humans tend to put on things. Our "you cant's" or "you should not's" become their "why not's." 

I was working on an application that cached some pages. Naturally, the challange I was facing was around [cache invalidation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_invalidation). I had been banging my head on this issue for about a month until one day I can home and my seven year old asked me what was on my mind. I told him what the problem was (we do that sort of thing in my household - share problems without expecting them to be fixed). He then replied with a statement that shattered my little dev world:

>"If it's giving you so many problems why don't you just stop using it?"

In an instant my son single handedly solved one of the [notoriously hardest problems in computer science](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html). With his suggestion in mind I removed it and all was well. 

You see the great deception isn't a lie or something sneaky someone else does to us it's something we convence ourselves of. Who you are at work and at home really should be the same person because you are the same person. We are free to bring our nerd home and share it with our family and friends; we owe it to them!
