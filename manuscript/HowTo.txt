# A Bit On This Book

**Nerd / Geek References:** This book is filled to the brim with quotes, perspectives, references and anecdotes from the nerd / geek culture. I'd encourage you to "research" any of the references where you do not have any personal experience. Of course when I say “research” I mean watch the movie, play the game or interact with the piece of technology mentioned (unless it’s a [Tardis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS), but if you do would you mind going to the future and letting me know if Half-life 3 ever gets created?).

**Stories:** One of the best ways to illustrate a point is, well through an illustration. You will find illustrations in this book but there are also series of stories that highlight things or provide clarity for some of the more abstract topics covered.

**Parables:** What’s that?! These are simple, short stories that help to teach a lesson. Throughout human history we have used parables whether verbal or written (like in the [bible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parables_of_Jesus)) to help teach thing in creative and clear ways. You’re probably wondering why I call these out separately from the **story** content. I do this because when you get to the “parables” section of the book my hope is that you’ll find stories that you can not only relate to but learn from as well.

**Projects:** How can you have a Nerd-life book without nerd-life projects?! You’ll discover projects sprinkled throughout this book that are intended to be shared with others. Hopefully these projects will help get you hacking on things with your family and friends, so that you can express your passions and excitement with them in a low friction way. The projects are also in this book so that there is a lower chance that it will end up as part of a monitor stand and act more as a handbook that is used over and over again.

There is much, much more packed in here but the above are highlights to explain that this is not a typical book. It’s more than bits, ink or paper. It’s an opportunity to finally [go where the dragons are](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_be_dragons) in your life and see what looking through a Nerd-Life awesome lens is all about.
