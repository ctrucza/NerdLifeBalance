#The Paradox

**I HAVE NO IDEA HOW I GOT HERE.**

It was a cold and rainy September day and I was riding down the Springwater corridor in Portland, Oregon like I did every day. Nodding mindlessly to the opposing riders or throwing a bell ring at those I was sharing the trail with. 

I was trapped by a thought; captivated by a problem. It was something I was carrying away from my desk at work. This made it difficult to focus on much of anything else. Given that I had gone down both the road of thought and the Springwater many times before I felt I could handle the multitasking. 

The funny thing about hubris through familiarity: you end up missing out on so many beautiful things around you and you usually end up with a tail between your legs because your perceived success ends up in actual disaster.  This time was no different.

I hit a railroad track that was running at a rough forty-five degrees to the road I was on. The rail groove was just wide enough for my tire to get caught in the crossing causing me to be thrown like a rag doll in one of those crummy physics games. I was so completely enthralled by my problem solving that I didn't even notice I had been thrown off until I hit the ground.  I thought to myself, "I have no idea how I got here."

For me this was a brutal truth over the first 20 or so years of my career.  It started out as an "I got this" moment and usually ended up with me stressed out over a project or two and me sleeping under my desk or on top of a table.  You may not be able to relate to the extreme side of my situation but perhaps you've had moments where you've looked up and wondered "how did I get myself into this situation?" Like boiling a frog, this "work and then life mentality" will enviably cook you and me.

I lay there on the ground. Wet, cold with a searing pain in my knee were I made first contact with alien ouch from the planet oblivious.  I just laid there in frustration over my spectacular flight but even more displeased that I had completely forgotten all that I had processed over the course of the eight mile ride from the office to the ground where I was laying. I rolled over on my back, winced and looked into the grey nether (more commonly known as Portland sunshine). 

A car passed me and honked as to say to me "watch out for that track; haven't you ever ridden a bike before!" I thought that it would be best to get up so I picked myself up with my extra slice of humble pie and a whole lot of respect for train tracks. I limped home over the next five miles with plenty of time to consider what had happened. 

At that moment I was doing two things I loved dearly: biking and solving a really hard software problem. Here's the part where you might expect me to launch into the whole "multitasking is a myth" monologue.  I'll save you from the droning and just put it this way: some call it multitasking, some call it multithreading; I like to think of it as Multidistrscting. 

Multidistrscting, simply put, is attempting to focus on more than one thing that you are really passionate about.  [Linda Stone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Stone) coined a term that closely represents the phenomenon of soaking in bits and pieces of the world around us as [continual partial attention](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_partial_attention). It's the idea of collecting a lot of data but never going deep with any of it.

It's the [Lawnmower Man effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lawnmower_Man_%28film%29). Achieve "genius" through sampling everything and experiencing nothing. We are all familiar with this idea; in biblical terms it's referred to as "trying to serve two masters." It would be like trying to learn Kung fu while learning Jiu Jitsu at the same time and doing it without the luxury of the Matrix! One does not simply live two lives and download all the things Neo. 

It's that ache in the back of your head when you put on the Lawnmower Man VR headset and just start munching through the motions and the billions of bits flying toward you. So instead of doing one thing really well you doing two or more things at half pace. 

So then how do you live a passionate life while doing the things you love with those you love? How do you live like you are going to fall of your bike without actually falling off?

I love a really good "weekend hack." One where you simply cannot get the idea out of your head and you've got to bend some metal, solder some connections or throw some bits just to breathe. Some of the best sessions that I have had around these ideas were with good friends. 

A few years ago I connected with a couple of amazing software developers and we decided that we were going to do fifty-two projects in a year, one each weekend. The goal was simple: do a seriously fun hack, learn something and share it with others. We did all of those things but after a while it began to get to be too much. I had a new baby on the way and we were all working at a place where we were not upholding the best work-life balances. It was amazing but it was also time to end it. I still have weekend hacks. Four kids later and I'm either working with those amazing kids or taking some alone time and get something knocked out. 

Before moving on, you'll notice I mentioned getting some "alone time" which implies doing a project by yourself.  My default on almost all of the projects I do will be to BAF(see the previous chapter) but there are times when [Mr. Furious](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_Men) rides in a wolf pack of one. Some projects call for a [Deus Ex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_Ex) approach of taking on the futuristic terror of undone projects alone and those can be equally as amazing, just make sure to share the results with others when you're done!

So what changed between then and now? The difference now is that the projects are planned and on purpose.  "Planned sounds too regimented" you might say. In the traditional sense planning for something might feel like it has the potential to choke out spontaneous innovation.  It's the opposite of that. 

This idea can be explained by a stack of Texas ribs.  Being from Texas I know that there are really only two food groups: BBQ and Tex-Mex. Most native Texans know that any good set of pork ribs have been soaked in a nice broth for a long time before they hit the grill. The meat absorbs the flavor of the broth and the end result is a far more amazing rib than if you just quickly threw some salts on the rack and toss them on the fire.

A> Side note: ribs make amazing LAN party food if you practice moderation - while folks are recovering from being slapped in the mouth by the killer ribs you just grilled you can get in a few extra frags. 

The idea here is to take the awesome idea that you just had and make it even more awesome by soaking it in or running it by a friend or family member. The set an execution date and do it. **The best ideas are toxic without execution**. In fact, just drop the idea of ideas all together and just start thinking in terms of projects. Thinking and being more concrete will act as a catalyst to your project war machine. 

What thought paradoxes turn you into the proverbial zombie? Perhaps a little soaking in the broth of planning and choice making will help keep you on the bike and help make sure you see your amazing project to its end.
