# The BAF

![](images/ch7.jpg)

In most [MMORPGs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game) there is a common term used for when players round up many [mobs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_%28video_gaming%29) (a computer controlled non-player charater; like a monster) on accident as they are either "passing through" or "farming" for quests and the like.  This term is BAF or "Bring A Friend." Often this is considered a bad thing because doing so causes unforeseen consequences.  The problem is that as a PC (player character) if you are trying to fight one thing and end up needing to fight two you might end up taking a dirt nap. 

BAF is MMORPG slang for the characteristic of some computer controlled bad guys when drawing aggro (attack behavior) from one or more nearby enemies to the character when pulled (attacked by the player). An enemy that has the behavior of bringing in more than one enemy to the player when pulled individually considered to be a "BAF mob." 

A several years ago there was an extremely popular [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkCNJRfSZBU) from the game World of Warcraft illustrating what can happen when the idea of "bringing a friend" goes bad.  

This is how the [event is described on wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeroy_Jenkins):
"The video was released by the World of Warcraft players' guild "PALS FOR LIFE". It features a group of players discussing a detailed battle strategy for the next encounter while one of their party members, Leeroy, is away from his computer. Their risky plan is needed specifically to help Leeroy, yet is ruined when Leeroy returns and, ignorant of the strategy, immediately charges headlong into battle shouting his own name in a stylized battle cry. His companions rush to help, but Leeroy's actions ruin the meticulous plan, and all of the group members are massacred."

Our friend Leeroy BAF'ed so many bad guys that he ended up flattening his group.  He was ironically going in alone dragging not only the creatures around but bringing his friends in as well.  

This principle applies very differently in real life. In fact instead of losing levels by bringing folks in you might actually have the opportunity to level up. 

A long time ago in a LAN party not so far away I learned the importance of sharing experiences and our beautiful design to create and build. There was three of us and we would start the weekend with a bike ride through back woods trails then head back to the house for some BBQ and an all nighter' of [Unreal Tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Tournament). It was good fun between good friends but we grew accustomed to each other's play style and behaviors. The gatherings only started getting really interesting when we started bringing other friends into the fold. This introduced new games, new styles of game play and a new set of fun challenges. Most importantly it helped us learn and grow together as friends. 

When I had my first kid, Caden, I would get frustrated that he'd get into my tools, breadboards and various RadioShack leftovers. I got frustrated because I didn't understand how principles of BAF could apply to friends and family. Once I began teaching my children how to make and contribute to the world around them, in kind, they began giving back to me. Their experience contributed to our collective experience new ways to do things and new ideas. 

Enthusiasm is infectious. Passion is magnetic. We call it charisma and we assign it to a subset of humanity. We think that you have to be a great speaker or an extrovert to have that magical attribute but the fact is that **charisma is simply the ability to communicate your passion**. 

We can observe this no matter where we are or who we are around.  If you love what you're doing it will most likely ooze from your pores.  The idea is simple: "Begin a movement by just being you."  I no longer tell my kids that we are going to do a project over the coming weekend; they now either bring me project ideas or I'll catch them in the middle of their own make.  

Over the years I have had many friends look at me oddly as I spoke vibrantly about something I loved.  I could generally write it off as I just look funny and they are giving me an appropriate response to that.  As I dug in more and more I discovered that what was going on was something extraordinary.  The contorted looks were coming from them processing an infection.  It's like this:

A friend tells you that you have got to try dipping your fries in your vanilla shake. To you the mere thought of dipping the crispy goodness of those tasty treats into anything other than your face makes you sad.  Your friend persists and you can tell they are speaking from a position of enthusiasm and you begin wondering if there is something to what they are saying.  Finally you find yourself doing what you never thought you would and you take the preverbal plunge into "shake fry fishing." You taste and you are well pleased.  In fact you are so delighted that you begin telling others about this amazing transcendence.  This is how we process infectious passion.  Sometimes it doesn't catch and sometimes it does.  The amazingly cool thing about passion is that it does not have to have a reason; it's its own reason. 

Each of us have a stockpile of life experience.  The pile often looks nothing like what we set out to build when we started our life but it is a beautiful disaster of experiences that are unique to you and no one else. We can choose to hold onto this collection and let it collect dusk like old MTG (Magic the Gathering) cards or we can use them in a game with others where we can learn and grow and help others do the same.

I started playing [MTG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering) in the early 90's.  As I collected the cards, I used them.   It was easy to spend an hour or so opening up a single booster pack. It was the smell of the mint condition cards, the feel of the prints in my hands and of course the beautiful content (art and writing) that made time stop.  With every pack a whole new experience was waiting for me; an opportunity to create new decks and new experiences for others.  This was not unique to Magic the Gathering. I personally had the same experience with baseball cards years earlier.   

We place a tremendous amount of value on inanimate things and trading cards are no exception.  Is it the beautiful art work or the value of the thing or player on the cards? I don't think so; at least not entirely.   For example, in the card game, Magic the Gathering, there is an extremely valuable card that has been known to sell for $125,000 signed!  That's six figures!  At first glance the card looks normal and perhaps uninteresting. It is also now banned in most tournaments so the card is virtually unusable.  So why the high sticker value?  It's because the card has "experience value."

Allow me to explain a bit about how the Magic the Gathering game works.  Players build decks with a minimum of forty cards (in a tournament) or sixty in normal play.  Game play is one to many and like any game there is a set of concrete rules and a set of "respect" rules that are simply followed for good etiquette.  

Everyone starts the game with twenty life and the basic goal of the game is to get the opposing player or players down to 0 before you.  You do this by using an amazingly robust set of cards that span the MTG universe. The card types include creature, artifact, enchantments, land (also known as mana - the currency of the game) and so on.  In MTG mana is everything.  

There is a collection of early series cards in the game called the [power 9](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Nine).  These are considered to be the most powerful / valuable cards in the game and one of them has the six figure price tag mentioned above: the Black Lotus. Six of those nine cards were mana generators that can give a tremendous amount of power to any player. I mentioned the core goal of the game was to reduce your opposing player's life to zero? The Black Lotus allowed you to do this in the very first turn of the game.  Here's how it worked:

At the beginning of the game each player draws seven cards. You only needed four cards to help you execute this amazing combo: a mountain land, Fireball, Channel and of course the Black Lotus. On your turn, you can play a single land. You would play the Mountain, and then put your Black Lotus out for zero mana. Lands do not have [summoning sickness](http://mtg.wikia.com/wiki/Summoning_Sickness), so you are able to use land and artifacts when you play them.

You then would use the [Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=382866), which will give you three green mana. Cast [Channel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=channel) and make 19 of your own life into 19 "colorless" mana. You now have that 19 colorless, one red and one green mana (from the Black Lotus) in your pool. "Tap" or use the mountain and cast [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=393831), which costs one red mana and X, where X is the number of mana. Take the 19 extra mana and add it to fireball and then add the last green mana still in your pool for a twenty damage Fireball. Game over, you win.

Now that you've recovered from MTG overload you're probably wondering "why all of the detail, I've never played MTG nor do I intend on ever playing." I described it this way to set up an experience. Can you imagine the excitement, the adrenaline, the shear intensity of being the player that draws this combo for the first time!  What if you're a [Tekken](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tekken), [Mortal Combat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortal_Kombat) or [Street fighter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter) player and you pull a combo that is only known as "technically" being possible? What if you have been working on a 3D model for months and it printed correctly on the first try? What about solving the unsolved algorithm?

The Black Lotus is valuable because of the emotion and excitement it brings to a situation. It can drive a normal experience to one of extreme splendor.

I've been blessed to see some of the most amazing accomplishments in my career.  At a place like New Relic this type of thing happens often: discovery, innovation, breakthroughs and doing the impossible are an ear mark of sorts for the people I get to work with.  The halls are filled regularly with "you've got to see this," "That possum's on the stump!" "I've almost solved it! So, I'm as busy as a one-legged cat in a sandbox!" Ok, so those last few were heard and interpreted by my Texan origins, but you get the point.  

It's the experiences that make us want to run around the room throwing high fives and people have a built-in desire to be a part of that.  Bringing your friends and family to join you in making and creating new things emboldens the experience.  Will you need to buy a new hammer on occasion because the kids left yours outside? Sure you will.  Will you get a chance to see the little ones you love so much have an amazing amount of delight when they find a Black lotus in what they built? Absolutely!

Accept that things will not go as planned and that stuff will break.  

So how will you BAF the next time you're doing something you're excited about?
